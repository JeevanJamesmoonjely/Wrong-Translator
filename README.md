# ❌ Wrong Translator

**Wrong Translator** is a fun and intentionally incorrect translation app. The idea is simple: select a source language and a target language, enter your text, and get a translation — but it's *wrong*! Whether you're building this as a parody project or an experimental tool, it's designed to give unexpected or incorrect translations.

## 🚀 Features

- Select **source language** and **target language**
- Input text in your chosen source language
- Generates a *wrong* or intentionally inaccurate translation
- Great for learning, fun, or creative projects

## 💡 Project Goals

This project was created to demonstrate how translation systems work — and how they can go hilariously wrong. It can be used as a mock app for testing language logic or for humor/parody use cases.


## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User selects a source language (e.g., English)
2. User selects a target language (e.g., French)
3. User inputs text
4. App returns a wrong or mismatched translation (e.g., instead of "Bonjour", it might return "Pineapple")

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- Optional: Backend with Node.js, Python Flask, etc.
- Optional: Fake or shuffled dictionary logic
