# Wrong Translator ðŸŽ¯

## Basic Details
### Team Name: The Mis-Translators

### Team Members
- Team Lead: MOHAMMED ARAFATH - SCMSSCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
- Member 2: JEEVAN JAMES - SCMSSCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY

### Project Description
**Wrong Translator** is a hilarious and intentionally incorrect translation tool that takes any text and translates it in a completely wrong, funny, and random way. Users can select source and target languages, input text, and get a totally bizarre translation in return.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world suffers from *too much* accurate translation. When people travel or communicate across languages, they get the right answers. But what about the *fun* of getting completely random and incorrect translations? We need a way to make translations confusing again!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created **Wrong Translator**â€”a tool that spits out wacky, nonsensical, and *totally wrong* translations, just for fun. It could also be used as a parody of language learning tools or just a good laugh with friends. Want to see "hello" turn into "pineapple" in French? This is your app!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries used**: [e.g., jQuery if used], custom logic for incorrect translations
- **Tools used**: Browser for viewing, text editor for coding (VS Code)

For Hardware:
- **N/A** (This project is purely software-based)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation

git clonehttps://github.com/JeevanJamesmoonjely/Wrong-Translator.git
